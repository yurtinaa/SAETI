# SAETI
This repository is related to the SAETI (Snippet-based Autoencoder for Time-series Imputation) a novel method for imputation of missing values in multidimensional time series that is based on the combined
use of autoencoders and a time series of behavioral patterns (snippets). SAETI is authored by Alexey Yurtin (iurtinaa@susu.ru) and Mikhail Zymbler (mzym@susu.ru), South Ural State University, Chelyabinsk, Russia.
